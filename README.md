# Sketch_Pad_App

This is my 2nd project.

This is a 'sort of...' sketchpad in which we can draw 'pixelated' (minecraft) type images with the help of custom grids.

This app includes functionality like:


Current iteration includes: 
- Adding custom grids.
- Toggle grid button that switches on/off the grids from display.
- Choose from a limited number of colors. (as of now)
- Raibow mode button that gives the drawing pen a random color (hue range from 0 to 255).
- Eraser to erase drawing from the display (basically adds the default white color...ðŸ˜Ž)
- Clear button to erase everything at once (it's for lazy people if they don't want to use      eraser).

Future iterations will include:
- A custom color picker instead of limited no:of colors to choose from.
- Export drawing as JPG.
- A slider button to choose no:of grids upto 64*64. (grids more than that becomes more CPU intensive)
